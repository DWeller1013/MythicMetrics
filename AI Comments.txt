Explanation of Key Features:
Hero Section:

Background with an image representing a WoW scroll. You can change it to something more specific (e.g., faction banners or dungeon images).
The title and subtitle are styled with Cinzel (for a medieval/fantasy look) and Roboto (for readability).
Leaderboard Section:

A table displaying the top Mythic+ runs, using a simple table element with alternating row colors and bold headers.
The leaderboard table uses gold accents for a WoW-like aesthetic.
Charts Section:

A Chart.js line chart to show dungeon completion times over a period, using a gold and dark theme. The graph displays dungeon names along the X-axis and completion times in minutes on the Y-axis.
Responsive Design:

The layout is mobile-friendly with media queries that adjust the font sizes and layout for smaller screens.
Assets You Can Customize:
Background Images: Replace the background image in the header section with other WoW-related textures, such as faction banners, dungeon backgrounds, or a WoW map.
Icons: You can integrate WoW-inspired icons in the leaderboard, such as class or dungeon-specific icons. You can download or design icons based on in-game assets.
Fonts: I've used Cinzel for headers to give a medieval vibe and Roboto for general text. You can change these fonts or use additional fantasy-themed fonts.
Additional Customization:
Fetch Data Dynamically: You can modify the leaderboard and chart data to be dynamically fetched from an API (such as the WoW Mythic+ API) instead of hardcoded data.
Improved Graphs: Add more interactive features to the graphs, like tooltips or zoom functionality, depending on the complexity of your data.
Conclusion:
This template provides a solid foundation for building your WoW Mythic+ leaderboard website with WoW-inspired aesthetics. You can customize the colors, icons, and data further based on your needs. With this base, you can build a visually engaging and functional site while staying within WoW's iconic visual style.
